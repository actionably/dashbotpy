"""scrubadub has some very conservative defaults (high recall) for identifying
filth. One of the key ways in which scrubadub can be customized is in improving
the precision of filth detection.

For example, if a user knows that the word 'iPhone' is not a person's name, but
a product, then a user should be able to easily adapt how scrubadub identifies
names.
